# 🎯 Guess My Number!
## 🧩 Version 1.0.0

A fun and interactive **JavaScript number guessing game** built while learning DOM manipulation in the *Complete JavaScript Course*. This project helped me practice working with the DOM, handling events, and managing game state using core JavaScript concepts.

## 🧩 Features
- Random number generation between 1 and 20  
- Real-time feedback messages (Too High, Too Low, Correct!)  
- Score tracking and high score functionality  
- Reset button to restart the game  
- Retro arcade-style UI using the “Press Start 2P” Google font  

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to **select and manipulate DOM elements** with JavaScript  
- **Event handling** with `addEventListener()`  
- Using conditional logic to update the UI dynamically  
- Applying **CSS styling** for visual feedback and layout design  
- Basic debugging through the browser console

## 🖥️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** for structure  
- **CSS3** for design  
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** for logic

## 🚀 How to Play
1. Enter a number between **1 and 20** in the input box.  
2. Click **“Check!”** to see if your guess is correct.  
3. If you’re wrong, hints will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.  
4. You start with **20 points**, losing one for every wrong guess.  
5. Try to beat your **high score!**  
6. Click **“Again!”** to restart.

## 🧩 Version 1.0.1

Added an event listener to the `.check` button that:
- Reads the user’s guess from the input field
- Logs the guess to the console
- Displays “🚫 No number!” if no guess is entered
